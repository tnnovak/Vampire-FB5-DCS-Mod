Vampire FB5 DCS World MOD

This is a rather still experimental version. Error reporting, feedbacks and improvement sugestions are wellcome.

Features not aviable, still WIP:

External fuel tanks
Complete damage model
EFM: Non-linear and spin behaviour, better compressibility effects

Many other small bugs
