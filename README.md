This is a rather still experimental version. Error reporting, feedbacks and improvement sugestions are wellcome.

## Features not aviable, WIP:

* External fuel tanks
* Complete damage model
* EFM: Non-linear and spin behaviour, better compressibility effects
* Gunsight algorithm
* Some instruments
* Air brakes
* Oxygen system
* Many other small bugs

## Works:
* basic EFM with flight envelope more or less close to Vampire curves
* Weapons: bombs and rockets
* Basic aircraft systems: pneumatic, hydraulic, electric and engine

## Cold startup Sequence

Check right panel switches below:

3. Low Pressure fuel valve ON
4. Throttle full back
5. Click gyro switch ON
6. Click booster pump ON
7. Click Ground power selector ON
8. Click engine start switch
9. Wait EGT and RPM to stablize at 3000 rpm (idle)

Dont move throttle too fast or engine will stall /  surge

If necessary: <br>
* external lights ON
* cockpit lights ON

On taxi: <br>
* <b>LCtrl + S</b> --> brakes left
* <b>LCtrl + D</b> --> brakes right
* <b>LAlt +  S</b> --> apply both brakes

Press F to deploy full flaps

Rotate about 100 mph

Press F to retract flaps, press G to retract gears (3 greens lights, gears down, 3 red lights gears retracting / extending, no lights gears retracted)

## Weapons controls

* Select Bombs or Rockets on B/R switch
* Select mode on Salvo mode switch (for rockets only): single or all

Turn gunsight ON on the gunsight ON/OFF switch<br>
Move sight:<br> 
* up/down --> LCtrl + I, LCtrl + M
* left / right --> LCtrl + I, LCtrl + M

Adjust gunsight size in the gunsight dial on the device front

## Flight controls

Pitch TRIM (check trim indicator, left side of the Gunsight):  
* , Trim UP
* . Trim Down

## Fuel System

Comsumption: Tip tanks first, wing tanks second, fuselage tank last

Full internal tanks, sea level, full throttle endurance: around 60 minutes
